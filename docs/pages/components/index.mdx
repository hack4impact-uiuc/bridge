The Bridge React component library are a collection of resuable interface of elements. It implements and extends the [Bridge Design system](/design). You will find the implementations of each UI component and additional components that help developers quickly create the best experience for our products.


### Installation
```
npm install @hack4impact-uiuc/bridge
```
or
```
yarn add @hack4impact-uiuc/bridge
```

### Usage

Import the CSS directly into your project (`src/index.js`) if your asset packager supports it:
```jsx
import '@hack4impact-uiuc/bridge/dist/styles.css'
```

Import required h4i-design components within `src/App.js` file or your custom component files:
```jsx
import { Button } from '@hack4impact-uiuc/bridge';
```

Now you are ready to use the imported components, such as:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@hack4impact-uiuc/bridge';

const App = () => (
    <Button onClick={() => alert('Button clicked!')}>APPLY NOW</Button>
)
export default App
```

#### Theming
Components use Hack4Impact's Design theme by default (`src/theme.js`) but you can provide your own theme using styled-component's [ThemeProvider](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced). You can either fully replace the theme or replace parts of the theme by placing your custom theme through a prop to our components or through `<ThemeProvider>` in the root of the application.

### Local Development
We use Storybook to hot-reload and test our components during development. You can edit the `playground/Playground.js` file to import and test the components you are working on. Please do not commit any work on the file so other developers can use the same file to test.

To run:
```
yarn
yarn storybook
```
