export const meta = {type: "components", title: "Box"}

export default Layout({...meta})

A `Box` is a `div` with styling props, allowing you to stay consistent with how you use other bridge components.

Use this in replacement of a `div`. It also includes flex properties - use `Box` as flexbox items with [`Flex`](/components/flex)

```jsx live
<Box bg="blue.1" width="100px" height="100px">
    Hi
</Box>
```


### Common Props
`Box` includes `COMMON`, `FLEX`, and `BORDER` props. Read [Common Props](/components/common-props) for details and API. These common props will override component props such as the color.
