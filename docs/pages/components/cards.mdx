`Card` is used to contain information together. There are multiple ways to customize the content within the card. Cards are 100% wide unless otherwise stated.

For information on Card style and usage guidelines, check out [Card Design Guidelines](/design/card).

#### Example

This example includes all Card components, which are: `Image`, `Content`, `Overline`, `Title`, `Subtitle`, `Body`, `Footer`. Unless it's media, put all content under `Card.Content` to have the correct spacing within the Card.

```jsx live
<Box width="324px">
    <Card>
        <Card.Image src="/docs-content/design/cards/BlueRectangle.svg"/>
        <Card.Content>
            <Card.Overline>Optional Overline</Card.Overline>
            <Card.Title>Card Title</Card.Title>
            <Card.Subtitle>Optional Subtitle</Card.Subtitle>
            <Card.Body>
                Here is some optional text that you can include in the card’s body so you can learn more about what the card is supposed to be for.
            </Card.Body>
            <Card.Footer>
                <Button.Group>
                    <Button>Action 1</Button>
                    <Button outline>Action 2</Button>
                </Button.Group>
            </Card.Footer>
        </Card.Content>
    </Card>
</Box>
```

#### A Card without Media but with 2 Links

You may pick and choose what elements may be inside the Card. 
```jsx live
<Card width="324px">
    <Card.Content>
        <Card.Title>Card Title</Card.Title>
        <Card.Body>
            Here is some optional text that you can include in the card’s body so you can learn more about what the card is supposed to be for.
        </Card.Body>
        <Card.Footer>
            <Link href="#" mr="12px">Link 1</Link>
            <Link href="#">Link 2</Link>
        </Card.Footer>
    </Card.Content>
</Card>
```

### Common Props
`Card`, `Card.Content`, `Card.Footer` includes `COMMON`, `BORDER`, `FLEX` common props since they wrap around the [Box](/components/box) component.

`Card.Body`, `Card.Title`, `Card.Overline`, `Card.Subtitle` includes `COMMON` and `TYPOGRAPHY` common props.

Read [Common Props](/components/common-props) for details and API. These common props will override component props such as the color.
