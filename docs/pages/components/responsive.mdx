Bridge components allow for responsive styling through its styling props from [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/). Styled system offers a convenient shorthand in dealing with responsive styles. For more details on styled system and their responsive styles [click here](https://styled-system.com/responsive-styles).

With Bridge, we have set breakpoints to which you may define styles for. Our Breakpoints (from our [design guidelines](/design/breakpoints)):

| Size        | Key Value |  Pixel Value     |
| ----------- | --------- |:----------------:|
| X-Small     | xs        | 544 px - 767 px  |
| Small       | sm        | 768 px - 991 px  |
| Medium      | md        | 992 px - 1279 px |
| Large       | lg        | 1280 px +        |

You may define the styles for any [Common Props](/components/common-props) at each breakpoint.
```jsx
<Box
  width={[
    1,    // 100% width below the X-Small (544px)
    1/2,  // 50% width from X-Small to Small (544px - 767px)
    1/4   // 25% width from Small and bigger (767px+)
    // note that you can continue to define it for `Medium to Large` and `Large and above
    // but in this configuration it will be 25% width from anything bigger than 767px
  ]}
/>

<Box m={["12px", "20px", "32px", "48px", "64px"]}> // responsive margins
```

#### What it does
Taken from Styled-System Docs:
```jsx
<Box width={[1, 1 / 2, 1 / 4]} />
```

will generate

```jsx

.Box-hash {
  width: 100%;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 40em) {
  .Box-hash {
    width: 50%;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 52em) {
  .Box-hash {
    width: 25%;
  }
}
```

#### Object instead Array

You may also define responsive styles with an object instead of an array. Their key values are listed in the table above under the "Key Value" column.

```jsx
<Box width={{ _ 1, sm: 1, md: 1 / 2, lg: 1 / 4 }} />
```
