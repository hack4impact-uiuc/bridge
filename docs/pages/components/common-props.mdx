Bridge uses [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) to add sets of styling props to components. This enables ease of styling via props.

There are a couple common styling prop groups that components may have. 

## COMMON
the `COMMON` common prop group is enabled in most components. This group of props includes styling for layout, spacing, and colors.

| Prop name | Type | Default | Description |
| :- | :- | :-: | :- |
|  |  | |  |
