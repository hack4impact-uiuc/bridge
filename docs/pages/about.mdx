Bridge is Design System we built at [Hack4Impact UIUC](https://uiuc.hack4impact.org) to boost the efficiency and consistency across all our products we build. As we work with different non-profits, we find ourselves designing and building out the same components over and over again - styles and colors may change but often times, the base of what we use stays the same. 

This is a live document of our style guidelines and will continue to change and evolve as we mature. If you encounter any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements, feel free to let us know on the [Issues page](https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc/bridge/issues) or even take an Issue yourself and contribute! Like most of our projects, it's open source so others may use it and reference it to build their own design system or products. Check out our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc/bridge/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on development.

<br />

Happy Building!
