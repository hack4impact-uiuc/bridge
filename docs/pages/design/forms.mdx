Bridge supports multiple form components. This page describes general form usage and structure. Specific form design patterns:
- [Text Fields](/design/text-fields)
- [Form Selections](/design/form-selections) - includes radio, checkboxes, and dropdowns
- [File Upload](/design/file-upload) 

#### Basic Structure for all forms
**Prompts**

Prompts should follow the Tables/Alerts/Forms text style and be
12 px from the form field.

They should be:
- Written in sentence case
- 1 to 4 words in length

**Section Titles**

Similar groups of information should be separated into sections.

They should be:
- Written in sentence case
- 1 to 4 words in length

#### Required/Optional Fields

Required and Optional fields should be denoted by italicized letters in primary blue body text following the input prompt.

#### Helper Text

Required and Optional fields should be denoted by italicized letters in primary blue body text 8px from the bottom of the input prompt.

#### Errors

Error messages should:
- Be colored in primary red
- Written in sentence case
- Visible immediately after the user has filled in an invalid input,
  NOT during
- Be removed immediately once the user enters a valid input

Prompts and Fields with errors should:
- Be colored in primary red
- Have borders in 1 px primary red

**Please look at documentation on each form component for examples and guides on their error state.**

#### Multi-step forms

Forms with steps should be broken up into individual pages so that the user isnâ€™t overwhelmed by a seemingly
endless scroll of content. Names of steps should be clearly labeled on each page.

<br/>

**Progress Bars**

Steps should be broken up into individual pages. Include status bars at the top so that the user knows where
they are in the process of completing the form at all times. Each step should be clickable.

<MultiStepForm/>

**Navigation Buttons**

Buttons to advance the user or bring the user back a step in the process of completing the form should be
in the bottom right of the form.

<FormNav/>
